    🍻 Cheers, I am Fabian,
an award winning frontend developer from rural Italy, currently living in ~~Sydney~~ on the road. I've worked with and for startups like Canva and Spreadshirt, helped companies like DDB Worldwide and Munich Airport deliver kick-ass campaigns and cutting edge web experiences, judged the best websites around the globe as a jury member at awwwards, fucked up my own startup Momate, worked as a wedding photographer, created fancy architecture visualisations as a 3d artist, played the shit out of Dota 2, backpacked 3 months through Vietnam with my lovely X100F and hiked 220km through freezing Swedish Lapland making friends with reindeers. I guess I like to stay active. 🤷🏻‍♂️
I have 9 years of experience as a developer and love working with React and other hip frameworks.
If you fancy a chat feel free to drop me a line.
Stay bold &

Have a polished Tuesday
